        <h3>UNIT TRUST TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p class="title_1">DEFINITIONS</p>
        <p class="content_1">AD Wealth<br/>The company that administers the unit trust(s), AD Wealth Inc. It is authorized to provide financial services. In this document it is referred to as ‘AD Wealth‘.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Unitholder<br/>The person/legal entity, including a trust, who has invested in AD Wealth unit trusts and in whose name the investment is held – addressed as ‘you‘.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Investment Account<br/>The account through which the unit trust(s) you choose is administered.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Portfolio of a Collective Investment Scheme<br/>This is an arrangement that enables investors to pool their money and have it professionally managed and invested in a range of underlying assets. The underlying assets of a Portfolio vary depending on the Portfolio’s investment objective. Portfolio’s are commonly referred to as ‘unit trust(s)‘ or ‘fund(s)‘. In this document the term ‘unit trust‘ is used.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Participatory interest in a Portfolio of a Collective Investment Scheme<br/>A Portfolio of a Collective Investment Scheme is divided into equal parts, also referred to as ‘units’. Each unit represents a direct proportionate interest in every underlying asset of the Portfolio. The number of units in your Investment Account depends on how much money you contribute and what the unit price is when the units are bought.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Business Day<br/>A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or Belize public holiday. In this document day and business day have the same meaning.</p>

        <p class="content_1">All instructions are subject to:
            <ul>
                <li>the requirements of AD Wealth and applicable legislation at the time of the transaction,</li>
                <li>the availability of the selected unit trusts,</li>
                <li>the processing requirements of AD Wealth (this includes cut-off times and time periods for processing),</li>
                <li>terms and conditions of AD Wealth, and</li>
                <li>minimum amounts specified by AD Wealth, applicable at the time of the transaction.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">AD Wealth may suspend, delay or withdraw your instruction due to any of the above.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Provide accurate information<br/>You must ensure that all information in instructions and supporting documentation that AD Wealth receives from you is true and accurate.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Make informed financial decisions<br/>If you require financial advice it is your responsibility to appoint a financial adviser. AD Wealth does not provide financial advice. It is also your responsibility to negotiate the fees payable for advice with your financial adviser.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Appoint or change your financial adviser<br/>You may appoint, change or remove your financial adviser at any stage by writing to AD Wealth. AD Wealth will inform your financial adviser of the change. If you remove your appointed financial adviser, this will take effect after five business days.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Make contributions<br/>You may make the following contributions:
            <ul>
                <li>initial lump sum</li>
                <li>additional lump sum</li>
                <li>recurring monthly contributions via debit order.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">Select your unit trust(s)<br/>You need to select one or more unit trusts that suit your investment needs and risk profile. Based on Exchange Control Act and Regulations and the discretion of AD Wealth, certain unit trusts may be subject to availability.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Monitor your unit trust(s)<br/>You are responsible for regularly reviewing your unit trust(s) and ensuring that it suits your circumstances. AD Wealth does not take responsibility for your selection.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Phase your investment into your selected unit trusts<br/>When you make an initial investment or an additional contribution you may phase your investment into your selected unit trust(s) monthly over 3, 6, 9 or 12 months. If you wish to phase your investment in, your contribution must initially be placed in the AD Wealth Money Market Fund or the AD Wealth Stable Fund. This option is subject to the minimums applicable at the time of the transaction.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Select your income distribution preference<br/>Unit trusts may earn interest and dividends from the underlying assets. This is declared as an income distribution if the interest and dividends exceed the total unit trust’s expenses. You need to indicate whether you prefer the income distribution to be paid directly into your bank account or reinvested, net of any applicable taxes.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Payment of Withholding Tax<br/>AD Wealth is obliged to pay Withholding Tax on your behalf. AD Wealth will deduct this tax before we distribute the distribution to you. The amount of tax you pay is based on various factors, including your tax residency. The maximum tax rate for Belize residents is defined in the Belize Income and Business Tax Act. Other tax rates depend on the Double Taxation Agreement between Belize and your resident country.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Switch between unit trusts<br/>You may switch between the available unit trusts. All switch transactions have two components:
            <ul>
                <li>sell units from your existing unit trust</li>
                <li>buy units in another unit trust</li>
            </ul>
            If the market value of a unit trust from which you wish to switch is less than the minimum amount prescribed by AD Wealth, AD Wealth will switch the whole amount. This amount must be switched into one unit trust.
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">Withdraw some or all of your investment<br/>You may withdraw some or all of your investment by selling the units in the Investment Account. You may also schedule regular withdrawals on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly basis. However, should the market value of the Investment Account decrease below AD Wealth’s required minimum balance after your withdrawal(s), AD Wealth may require you to withdraw the remaining balance.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Transfer ownership<br/>You may request a transfer of some or all of your units in your Investment Account to another legal entity. This may result in a payment of Capital Gains Tax.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Transfer your investment to the AD Wealth Investment Platform<br/>You may transfer your investment to the AD Wealth Investment Platform if you want to access a wider selection of unit trusts.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Report errors<br/>You have 14 days after receipt of the investment confirmation or any statement from AD Wealth to report any errors.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Notify AD Wealth of changes in bank or contact details<br/>You need to inform AD Wealth of any changes in your bank or contact details, including your postal and email address, and provide supporting documentation where appropriate.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Cede the units<br/>You may cede some or all of your units in your Investment Account as security. It is your responsibility to manage the cession.</p>
        <p class="title_1">WHAT ARE AD WEALTH’S RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES?</p>
        <p class="content_1">Accept or reject instructions<br/>AD Wealth may accept or reject your application or any subsequent instructions. AD Wealth may also reverse a transaction if it decides the circumstances justify it.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Communicate with you<br/>AD Wealth will communicate with you. You are entitled to any information that the law requires a Manager or listed company to disclose.<br/>You may select whether the financial adviser receives communication on your behalf. Where you have made no selection:
           <ul>
               <li>transaction confirmations will be sent to both you and your appointed financial adviser;</li>
               <li>quarterly statements and other communication will only be sent to you</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">Confirm changes<br/>AD Wealth will confirm any changes made to your investment with you.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Provide statements<br/>AD Wealth will provide you with quarterly statements and per request, certificates of income and capital gains for taxation purposes where applicable.<br/>Additional statements are available from the secure section of www.ad-wealth.com.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Processing of Personal Information<br/>You acknowledge that AD Wealth requires your personal information, as defined in Freedom of Information Act (2000), and consent to AD Wealth processing such information to open and administer your investment accounts. In addition, you expressly consent that AD Wealth may verify and process your personal information for security purposes and so as to comply with its obligations in terms of legislation. AD Wealth may transmit your personal information to third-party service providers for the purposes of storing and maintaining that information. Where information is transmitted to offshore providers, AD Wealth has confirmed that sufficient legislation and agreements are in place to ensure the protection of that information. Where directed by your financial adviser, AD Wealth will transmit your information to third-party service providers appointed by your adviser.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Process all instructions<br/>AD Wealth is responsible for processing your instructions. AD Wealth will process your instruction once all supporting documentation is received and requirements are met.<br/>Unit prices are calculated daily at 16:00 by taking the total value of all assets of the unit trust, including any income accrual less permissible deductions, and dividing that by the number of units created for the unit trust. Because pricing takes place at the close of each business day, the price is only available the following business day.</p>

The applicable exchange rates and bank charges must be confirmed with your bank, while the fee payable to the Central Bank of Belize will be deducted from the withdrawal amount whether or not the Central Bank of Belize approves the request. Offshore payment timelines will be impacted by the turnaround times and requirements of the Central Bank of Belize.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Remove a unit trust<br/>If for any reason a unit trust you selected is no longer available, AD Wealth will give you written notice. AD Wealth will ask you to select an alternative from the list of remaining unit trusts.</p>

                <li>a copy of the death certificate, and your investor number.</li>

        </p>
        <p class="title_1">WHAT IS AD WEALTH NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR?</p>
        <p class="content_1">Advice<br/>AD Wealth does not give advice and does not employ financial advisers.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Certain losses suffered<br/>AD Wealth is not responsible for any losses that may be suffered due to:
            <ul>
                <li>the investment or market risk of the underlying investments;</li>
                <li>changes in tax or other legislation;</li>
                <li>delays in the processing or the rejection of an application because</li>
                <li>the financial adviser is either not an authorized Financial Services Provider or does not have a contract with AD Wealth;</li>
                <li>financial advisers acting beyond the scope of their FSB license;</li>
                <li>unauthorized instructions given by the financial adviser;</li>
                <li>the failure of any networks or electronic or mechanical devices;</li>
                <li>AD Wealth providing your appointed financial adviser with details about your investment either via email a secure website;</li>
                <li>AD Wealth acting on information sent electronically;</li>
                <li>AD Wealth acting on incorrect information where you have failed to notify them of any changes to such information; or</li>
                <li>the delayed sale of units in a unit trust due to ring-fencing.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">Delays in processing instructions<br/>AD Wealth will carry out instructions at the earliest possible opportunity, subject to legislation, its own administration procedures and any unit trust limitations. AD Wealth does not accept responsibility for delays in processing instructions as a result of extraordinary events that cause disruptions.</p>
        <p class="title_1">WHAT DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT?</p>
        <p class="content_1">Cancellation<br/>You cannot cancel the investment and there is no cooling-off period. However, you may sell the units of the Investment Account at the ruling unit price.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Investment guarantees<br/>The market value of the units may go down as well as up, and past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future. Unit trusts are therefore generally medium- to long-term investments. You carry the investment risk, which includes the possibility of losing capital.</p>
        <p class="title_1">WHAT FEES AND CHARGES DO YOU PAY?</p>
        <p class="content_1">If a fee or charge is levied, this is passed on to you by reducing the underlying investments of the Investment Account by the same amount.<br/>Your choice of unit trusts will determine certain aspects of the fee structure.<br/>Where applicable, these fees and charges are levied proportionately across all unit trusts of the Investment Account. You may choose to have your annual administration and annual adviser fees deducted from your AD Wealth Money Market Fund. This will be known as your preferred fee unit trust.<br/>If the preferred fee unit trust does not have sufficient funds to pay the fees, AD Wealth will deduct fees from the unit trust(s) where the fees have accrued. If there is an insufficient balance in that unit trust AD Wealth will deduct fees proportionately from the remaining unit trusts.</p>
        <p class="content_1">AD Wealth may be required to pay any charges due to a change in:
            <ul>
                <li>tax (including any new tax),</li>
                <li>legislation,</li>
                <li>practice, or interpretation of any legal or regulatory authority.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">There are generally three types of fees that may be deducted from your investment on an initial and annual basis:
            <ul>
                <li>administration fees,</li>
                <li>investment management fees, and</li>
                <li>financial adviser fees.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">Initial fees<br/>Initial fees are deducted before the investment is made.
            <ol>
                <li>Administration fee<br/>There is no initial administration fee.</li>
                <li>Investment management fee<br/>There is no initial investment management fee.</li>
                <li>3Financial adviser fee<br/>If you and your financial adviser agree to an initial financial adviser fee (as indicated in the application form or any other written communication acceptable to AD Wealth), AD Wealth will deduct the agreed amount from the investment before the investment is made.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">Annual fees<br/>All annual fees are calculated daily, based on the market value of the investment at the end of each day.
            <ol>
                <li>Administration fee<br/>A portion of the investment management fee may be used to cover administration costs.</li>
                <li>Investment management fee Annual investment management fees are charged. These fees vary per unit trust; they may be fixed or performance related. There are also other allowable expenses associated with unit trusts. These fees and expenses are deducted within the unit trust, and are therefore accounted for in the unit trust’s published performance figures. Please refer to the relevant unit trust minimum disclosure documents or unit trust brochure for more details.</li>
                <li>Financial adviser fee<br/>If you and your financial adviser agree to an annual financial adviser fee (as indicated in the application form or any other written communication acceptable to AD Wealth), AD Wealth will deduct the fees by selling units from the unit trust and pay the amounts to the adviser monthly.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">Other fees
            <ol>
                <li>Termination or unit trust exit fee<br/>There is no fee when you withdraw your investment from the AD Wealth unit trust.</li>
                <li>Unit trust switching fee<br/>AD Wealth does not currently charge a switching fee.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="content_1">Permissible deductions<br/>There are other charges (in addition to unit trust management fees) that may be deducted from the unit trust. These are to cover bank charges, trustee/custodian fees, audit fees, securities transfer tax (STT), brokerage and value-added tax (VAT).<br/>These expenses are included in the published price of the unit trust.</p>
        <p class="content_1">Value added tax (VAT)<br/>VAT may be added to any fees or charges relating to your investment.</p>
